BLESuite_CLI README

BLESuite_CLI is a command line tool to enable an easier way to test Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. 
This tool uses the BLESuite Python library, which utilizes pygattlib and the Bluez Bluetooth stack, allowing 
us to scan, read from, and write to BLE devices using Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) over the 
Attribute protocol (ATT). The goal of this tool is to create an alternative to the Bluez gatttool typically 
used for communicating with BLE devices using the GATT/ATT protocol.

Features:
    * Command line tool and stand-alone Python package
    * Scan for BTLE devices
    * Scan BTLE devices for primary services and characteristics
    * SmartScan - Scan a BTLE device for basic information, primary services, characteristics, and then 
    determining which descriptors are present, their handle, permissions, and current value (if applicable)
    * Write arbitrary values to a BTLE device
    * Read values from a specific handle and/or UUID on a BTLE device

Features still underway or planned:
    * Still finishing subscribe command line option, but the basics are in place
    * Investigating man-in-the-middle techniques that can be added

Note to the reader:
    This tool was developed and tested on Debian 8. Specifically the testing distribution that
        includes a more current version of the Bluez Bluetooth stack (version 5.36 at the time of writing this)

    In order to access Bluetooth Low Energy functionality, you must have access to a Bluetooth adapter that
        supports it.

Installation Requirements:
    * BLESuite
    
To run command line tool:
   Run directly using python bleSuite-runner.py
